This script uses any set of transcripts to identify cases where a transcript is split over multiple genome fragments 
and attempts to use this information to scaffold the genome.

Align the transcripts to the genome:

  Use BLAT to align the transcripts to the genome.

Identify informative split transcripts:

  All transcripts that mapped to more than one contig are flagged. Each mapping is
then analysed to identify those that map consecutive non-overlapping sections of the
transcript on separate contigs allowing for an overlap buffer zone of up to 20bp.

Create scaffolds:

  Each transcript-contig complex is assembled by orientating the contigs based on the
BLAT information and adding 10 Nâ€™s in-between the contigs. 

Cluster scaffolds into groups and assemble:

  The contigs used in each transcript-contig complex are then cross-referenced and any
complexes sharing a contig are grouped. Groups are then assembled using CAP3 and
default parameters.

Filter the assemblies:

  The assemblies are parsed to identify successful assembly events. Failed assemblies
are identified and the largest complex kept, the remainder removed.

  Create new contig set:

A new contig set is generated using the successful CAP3 assemblies, the remaining
complexes and any contig not involved.
